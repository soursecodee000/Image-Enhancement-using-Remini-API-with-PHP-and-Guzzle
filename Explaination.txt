This PHP script is an example of how you might use the Remini API to enhance an image. 
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1.Include necessary dependencies:


require_once 'vendor/autoload.php'; // Assuming Guzzle is installed via Composer


This line includes the autoload file, assuming Guzzle is installed using Composer. Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client.

2.Import required classes:

use GuzzleHttp\Client;


This line imports the Client class from Guzzle, which will be used to make HTTP requests.

3.Set up API key and image path:

$apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
$imagePath = 'path/to/your/image.jpg';


Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Remini API key. Set the $imagePath variable to the path of the image you want to enhance.

4.Encode image data:



$imageData = file_get_contents($imagePath);
$base64Image = base64_encode($imageData);
$imageMd5 = base64_encode(md5($imageData, true));


Read the image data, encode it in base64 format, and compute the MD5 hash of the image data, then encode the MD5 hash in base64 format.

5.Construct the request:

$client = new Client();
$url = 'https://api.remini.ai/v1/tasks';
$headers = [
    'Authorization' => 'Bearer ' . $apiKey,
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json',
];
$body = [
    'tools' => [
        [
            'type' => 'face_enhance',
            'mode' => 'beautify'
        ],
        [
            'type' => 'background_enhance',
            'mode' => 'base'
        ]
    ],
    'image_md5' => $imageMd5,
    'image_content_type' => 'image/jpeg', // Adjust based on image format
    'output_content_type' => 'image/jpeg', // Adjust if desired
];




Create a Guzzle client, set the API endpoint, headers, and request body. The body includes the tools to use for enhancement (face and background), image MD5 hash, and content types.


6.Send the request:

$response = $client->post($url, [
    'headers' => $headers,
    'json' => $body,
]);



Use the Guzzle client to send a POST request to the Remini API with the specified headers and JSON-encoded body.

7.Process the response:

$responseData = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);
$taskId = $responseData['task_id'];



Decode the JSON response from the API, extract the task ID, 
and store it in the $taskId variable.

8.Track task status and download enhanced image:
The code doesn't include this part. According to the comment, 
you need to refer to the Remini API documentation for details on how to track the task status and download the enhanced image. 
This typically involves making additional API requests with the task ID.


} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle errors gracefully
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}


If an exception occurs during the API request, catch the exception and handle errors gracefully by printing an error message.

Remember to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual Remini API key and handle the task status tracking and image download according to the Remini API documentation.
